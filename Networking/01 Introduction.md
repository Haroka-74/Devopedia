# **Network**
- *A network is a group of interconnected devices (hosts) that communicate with each other through various types of links, enabling them to share resources, exchange data, and transfer files efficiently*

# **Network Architectures**
- ### P2P Architecture
    - *P2P (Peer-to-Peer) architecture refers to a decentralized communication model where devices (peers) connect directly with each other without the need for an intermediary or central server, each peer can act as both a client and a server, enabling efficient resource sharing and file transfer*
- ### Indirect Architecture
    - *Indirect architecture involves communication between two devices via one or more intermediaries, such as switches, routers, or gateways, this model allows for scalable and managed communication in larger networks, often seen in traditional client-server setups*
- ### Multiple Access Architecture
    - *Multiple access architecture is a collection of techniques and protocols that enable multiple devices to access and share the same communication medium simultaneously, without interference, common methods include time-division multiplexing `(TDM)`, frequency-division multiplexing `(FDM)`, and carrier sense multiple access with collision detection `(CSMA/CD)`*
- ### Client-Server Architecture
    - *Client-Server architecture is a network model where clients (devices or software applications) request services or resources from a centralized server, the server processes these requests and returns the appropriate responses, typically in a structured and secure manner, this model is widely used for web applications, databases, and networked systems*

# **Network Types**
- ### Personal Area Network (PAN)
    - *PANs are designed to connect devices within a short range, typically around one person, commonly used for personal devices such as smartphones, tablets, and wearables, technologies include Bluetooth, NFC, and USB*
- ### Local Area Network (LAN)
    - *LANs are designed to connect devices within a limited area (e.g., home, office, or school), providing fast data transfer speeds and typically used for connecting computers, printers, and other devices, technologies include Ethernet and Wi-Fi*
- ### Campus Area Network (CAN)
    - *CANs are designed to connect multiple LANs within a limited geographic area (e.g., university campus, corporate campus, or industrial complex), allowing for large-scale communication within the area, technologies include fiber optics and Ethernet*
- ### Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)
    - *MANs are designed to connect multiple LANs across a city or metropolitan area, providing high-speed connectivity for organizations or public use, often used by ISPs or larger institutions, technologies include fiber optics, microwave transmission, and WiMAX*
- ### Wide Area Network (WAN)
    - *WANs are designed to connect devices and networks over large geographic areas (e.g., countries or continents), typically used for internet connectivity and connecting geographically dispersed organizations, technologies include the Internet and satellite links*

# **Network Links**
- ### Guided Media:
    - *Uses physical cables or conductors to transmit data, providing stable and high-speed transmission, commonly used in wired connections, examples include twisted pair cables (Ethernet), coaxial cables (TV cable), and fiber optic cables*
- ### **Unguided Media**
    - *Uses wireless communication where data is transmitted without physical cables, providing flexibility and mobility in communication, examples include radio waves, satellite communication, and Wi-Fi*

# **Network Devices**
- ### Hub
    - *A hub is used to broadcast data to all devices in the network, and only the intended destination device accepts the data while other devices discard it, typically used in smaller networks or legacy systems*
- ### Switch
    - *A switch is used to connect `multiple devices` within the same network and forwards data to the intended destination device, improving network efficiency and reducing collisions compared to hubs*
- ### Router
    - *A router is used to connect `multiple networks` together, such as a local network to the internet, and routes data between networks using IP addresses, often used to manage traffic and security in home or enterprise networks*
